      `When I started my Altschool journey, I thought the program would be an easy, minimal effort adventure lol. This is because the first semester was relatively easy for me, perhaps because I am a graduate of Computer Science.

But the second semester humbled me. React proved to be a challenge, not because it's inherently difficult, but because it demands a deep understanding of JavaScript. 

It's been an interesting journey filled with learning new ways to tackle problem.`
