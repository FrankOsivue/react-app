        "With the benefits of hindsight, if I am faced with the same decision, I will choose computer science in a heartbeat, every day and every time.",
          "Computer Science teaches problem-solving, algorithms, and logical thinking, which perfectly describes the kind of stuff I love."]

      ["Huawei ICT Competition is an annual global ICT competition with participation from countries all-around the world. I was one of the participants representing Nigeria in the 2025/2026 edition of the competition, and I made it to national final stage of the competition. Here are some lessons, especially for anyone preparing to participate:",
        "1. Start early: It is true what people say, those who fail to plan, plan to fail. Huawei competition is hard and competitive (more than 150k students participated in the 2025 edition), so it takes good preparation to standout.",
         "2. Collaborate: It doesn't matter if you are Vin Cerf and Danny Cohen rolled into one, if you don't work with others, you chances of any success is near zero. This is because participants are evaluate on a team basis.",
           "3. Learning space is your primary resource: you may find it tempting to use other resources to complement your learning, that is actually good, but as far as Huawei Competition is concerned, the resources provided in the learning space is your best option."]

     [ "When I started my Altschool journey, I thought the program would be an easy, minimal effort adventure lol. This is because the first semester was relatively easy for me, perhaps because I am a graduate of Computer Science.",
     
"But the second semester humbled me. React proved to be a challenge, not because it's inherently difficult, but because it demands a deep understanding of JavaScript.",
"It's been an interesting journey filled with learning new ways to tackle problem."]
